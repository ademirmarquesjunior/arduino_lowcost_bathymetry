Monitoring the available volume of raw water in reservoirs is essential to ensure security of supply to the population. Climate change and global warming had substantially changed the weather bringing constant droughts and unexpected rainfalls, making the correct estimation of water bodies an important matter. The technique for recognizing water bodies is called bathymetry, where by a sonar and embedded global positioning system (GPS) collect data to recreate the depth topography. However, this work is costly and exposes the assessment team to health risks. Therefore, we are proposing a prototype of a semi-automated portable bathymetry equipment to facilitate data collection and thus enable more frequent updates of reservoir volume. The objectives of this work were to construct a reduced model of a vessel and to calibrate an adapted ultrasonic sensor for depth measurement. The ultrasonic sensor mounted on an ARDUINO micro-controller was tested in the FATEC-Jahu's test tank and its readings were compared against measurements made manually. We conclude that the reduced model is stable for data collection with an operational range between 1.0 and 20.0 meters when considering a linear adjustment of the sensor readings achieving an $R^2$ score of 0.9998.
